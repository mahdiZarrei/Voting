Blockchain voting is a digital way of voting that uses blockchain technology. Here's how it works:

1. Registration: Citizens register and verify their identity on the blockchain.
2. Immutable Votes: Votes are recorded on the blockchain, making them unalterable and transparent.
3. Counting: The blockchain ensures accurate vote counting, leading to quick and clear election results.
   In summary, blockchain voting brings secure, transparent digital balloting, ensuring immutable and verifiable votes for enhanced democratic processes.
